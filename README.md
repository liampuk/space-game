# Space Game (temp title)

An initial concept for a multiplayer space colonisation game.

The game world will be a version of the milky way, merging actual star data with generated stars to pad out the galaxy (similar to elite dangerous). Each system will have a random number of planets, each with procedurally generated properties and terrain.

Players will be able to colonise the planets, building up their civilisations and vying for control of their planet and it's system. Most of the gameplay will be split between civ management of their settlements, and flying their ship to trade/fight/explore/settle new worlds (a la FTL/Elite Dangerous).

## Inspiration

Terrain generation is inspired by various examples of procedural terrain generation, for example this one [Arvi "Hempuli" Teikari's blog:](https://www.hempuli.com/blogblog/archives/186)

The space exploration concept is inspired by Elite Dangerous and its galaxy map:

The settlement management is somewhat inspired by factorio, though won't use conveyor belts/power lines and hopefully won't be as brown.

***I have never developed a game (other than 2048) so this will likely take some time/not happen.***
